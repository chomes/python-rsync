# python-rsync
## Intro
Python rsync is a tool to back up files locally and remotely from your computer.  
It was a project I originally made as a script to call the rsync command at the start when I first learned python and I wanted to do something fun,
to now become a project where as I have learned more become a full blown stand alone rsync like client that can be used on any platform.

## How this works
